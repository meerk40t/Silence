# CH341

The interactions with the CH341 Universal USB Interface chip are highly required for any controller boards which use the chip to interface a particular board to to a computer USB connection. These are popular in both production and hobbyist functions, and the chips are cheap and ubiquitous. Both the Lhystudios boards and the Moshiboards use this chip type. It's also possible and likely to find these in some Arduino systems and for hobbyists to use them.
