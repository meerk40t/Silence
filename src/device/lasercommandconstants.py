"""
Laser Commands are a middle language of commands for spooling and interpreting.

NOTE: Never use the integer value, only the command name. The integer values are
permitted to change.

COMMAND_PLOT: takes a plot object to generate simple plot commands.
Simple plot values are x, y, on. Where x and y are the position in absolute values and on is whether the laser fires
for that particular move command.

A COMMAND_RESUME would have to be issued in realtime since in a paused state the commands are not processed.
